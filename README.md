# Ubiquant-Market-Prediction
This project is done by Tingran Sheng and Echo Zhao in Jan 2022. It is a public Kaggle competition, which you can find the detail [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ubiquant-market-prediction/overview)

## What is the project about?
Given the timestamp each investment happend and some features associated with each investment, we need to predict the overall return of each investment. 

## Data
- Features:
  - `time_id`: the timestamp when the investment happened
  - `investment_id`: id for one investment
  - `f_0` - `f_300`: anonymized features
- Target:
  - `target`: investment return rate
 
 ## File Structure
 ### Notes
 - We put our notes about the points we learned under `/Notes`. Hope you find it helpful.
 
 ### Notebooks
 - We made multiple jupyternotebooks for the analysis as well as modeing.
